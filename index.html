			<h2 class="font">Here's a time-line of Sengbe Pieh's life:</h2>
			<ul class="font" style="text-align: justify;">
				<p>Sengbe Pieh was a Muslim-born child of Sierra Leone who landed by accident in America in 1839 on board the Spanish slave ship called the ‘Amistad’. The landing was by accident because the navigator of the ship deceived Sengbe by sailing the ship towards America instead of Africa after Sengbe had led 48 other captives to seize the captain and crew of the ship in the high seas, put them under their control and ordered their navigator to sail the vessel back to Africa. But the navigator deceptively disobeyed his orders by doing the opposite. So Sengbe and his compatriots were taken by surprise when they found themselves on the shores of Long Island in New York in the July of 1839 following 63 days of their high sea bravery. From Long Island, the ship was towed to Connecticut where Sengbe and the 48 others were jailed in New Haven and made to await trial for murder and mutiny.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Fortunately, the New Haven judge ruled that “the Africans had been kidnapped and had the right to use violence to escape from captivity.” This ruling took place at the time when slavery was banned on US soil. Hence, Sengbe made history as the first to capture his capturers and to free himself and 48 others from slave captivity during a voyage.  How could this have been possible? Start by throwing light on the humble beginning of Sengbe and on the bravery history of his tribe.  Sengbe was the son of Kaamoh Mustapha Perry, town chief of Gendema in Gallinas Perry chiefdom where Siaka Massaquoi was king. Young Sengbe grew up to assume his father’s occupation as a rice farmer on the fertile bolly lands that stretched from Gbondapi to Torma-Bum in the south of Sierra Leone. He was also trained as a blacksmith, specialized in smelting implements of agriculture and warfare with skills in unlocking padlocks, in using metal implements to ambush wild animals, and in diverting enemy attacks through poro war tactics.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The warrior root of the Mende and Vai tribes into which Sengbe was born can be traced to the Mane invasion historically linked to the army of Alhaji Mansa Kankan Moussa who ruled the ancient West African empire of Mali and was regarded as the richest man in history. The acclaimed Sierra Leonean historian, Arthur Abrahams, backed by linguistic experts such as Taasiv Koroma, contributed immensely towards the demystification of the man whose name had been wrongly recorded in western history books as Joseph Cinque.</p>
